Application
    SbmBloodFoam

Description
    The SbmBloodFoam application solves the modified suspension balance model (MSBM) equations for the flow of red blood cells
(RBCs) and other deformable particle suspensions in confined geometries. A lift force term "LiftF" and other hemorheology features
are incorporated into the conventional suspension balance model (SBM) on top of the SbmFoam solver (originally developed by Dbouk et. al.)
to create the SbmBloodFoam solver, which is able to predict both the transient and steady-state hematocrit and velocity profiles and 
the development of the cell-free layer characteristic of blood flows.

Compile first the application with wclean, followed by wmake


tutorial:
The tutorial Folder includes an example case for a 2D blood flow in a channel 
starting at a bulk concentration of 20% and a lift force exponent value of
beta=1.2. This simulation uses realistic blood flow parameter values, which 
can be found in the file named "transportProperties" within the folder called 
"constant". In that file, don't forget to specify the channel height of your mesh.

A parabolic inlet velocity profile imposed in this case in 0/U Folder via 
the "codedFixedValue" utility, but you can opt to impose a constant inlet 
velocity profile. 

Post-procesing:
Don't forget to zoom in to observe well the geometry.
