#The SbmBloodFoam solver

Description
    The SbmBloodFoam application solves the modified suspension balance model (MSBM) equations for the flow of red blood cells
(RBCs) and other deformable particle suspensions in confined geometries (channels). A lift force term "LiftF" and other hemorheology features
are incorporated into the conventional suspension balance model (SBM) on top of the SbmFoam solver (originally developed by Dbouk et. al.)
to create the SbmBloodFoam solver, which is able to predict both the transient and steady-state hematocrit and velocity profiles and 
the development of the cell-free layer characteristic of blood flows.

To simulate tubular flows, use the SbmBloodTubeFoam application instead.

Compiling the files
Within the SbmBloodFoam folder, compile the files using the wmake command. 

tutorial:
The tutorial folder includes two cases: 
1. An example case for a 2D blood flow in a channel starting at a bulk hematocrit 
of 20% (specified in the 0/c folder) and a lift force exponent value of beta=1.2. 
A parabolic inlet velocity profile imposed in this case in 0/U folder via the 
"codedFixedValue" utility, but you can opt to impose a constant inlet velocity profile.
2. The simple shear flow of blood between two parallel plates, where a constant velocity
field is imposed at the top wall, while a zero-slip condition is imposed at the bottom
plate.

Both cases use realistic  blood flow parameter values, which  can be found in the file 
named "transportProperties" within the folder "constant". In that file, don't forget 
to specify the channel height of your mesh.

Post-procesing:
Don't forget to zoom in to observe well the geometry.
