Application
    SbmFoam

Description
    Transient solver for incompressible, suspensions flow of spherical particles immersed in a Newtonian-Fluid
    (note: particles considered as a continuum medium but of concentration "c" ).

compile first the application with wmake


tutorial:
The tutorial Folder includes an example case for a 2D suspension flow in a channel 
starting at a bulk concentration of 30%
(A parabolic inlet velocity profile imposed in this case in 0/U Flder via "groovyBC" library)
(however one can imposes a constant inlet velocity profile)

Post-procesing:
Don't forget to zoom in to observe well the geometry.
